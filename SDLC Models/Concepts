Software development models are various processes or methods that are chosen for project development depending on the objectives and goals
of the project. Many development life cycle models have been developed to achieve various essential objectives. Models specify 
the various steps of the process and the order in which they are executed.

What is Software Modeling?
Software modeling is the process of creating abstract representations of a software system. These models serve as blueprints that
guide developers, designers, and stakeholders through the systemâ€™s structure, behavior, and functionality.

By using diagrams and various modeling languages, software modeling helps in visualizing and understanding 
the complex aspects of the software, making it easier to plan, develop, and manage the system.

Top 8 Software Development Models
Choosing the right model is very important for the Development of a Software Product or application. Development and 
testing processes are carried out based on the model.

Different companies, depending on the software application or product, choose the type of development model whichever is 
appropriate for their application. But these days 'Agile Methodology' is the most popular in the market.


1. Agile Model
Agile Development Model is a combination of iterative and incremental models, that is, it is made up of iterative and incremental models.
In Agile model, focus is given to process adaptability and customer satisfaction.
In earlier times, iterative waterfall model was used to create software. But in today's time developers have to face many problems.
The biggest problem is that in the middle of software development, the customer asks to make changes in the software. 
It takes a lot of time and money to make these changes. So to overcome all these shortcomings, the agile model was proposed in the 1990s.


The Agile Model was created mainly to make changes in the middle of software development so that the software project can be completed quickly.

1.In the agile model, the software product is divided into small incremental parts. In this, the smallest part is developed first 
and then the larger one.
2.And each incremental part is developed over iteration.
3.Each iteration is kept small so that it can be easily managed. And it can be completed in two-three weeks. 
Only one iteration is planned, developed and deployed at a time.
